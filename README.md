# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what i've learn't in the Dicee tutorial. This app will guide me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and I will also apply what I have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I created

You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
